# Understanding the Dataset

[Data Sourced from ENCODE RUSH AD](https://www.encodeproject.org/brain-matrix/?type=Experiment&status=released&internal_tags=RushAD)

## We have three types of transcriptomic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
1. total RNA-seq
2. long read RNA-seq
3. mircro RNA-seq

## We have donors of various ages.

## Finally, we have five disease states
1. No Cognitive Impairment
2. Mild Cognitive Impairment
3. Cognitive Impairment
4. Alzheimer's Disease
5. Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Impairment
